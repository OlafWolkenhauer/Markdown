# Markdown Template, Testfile and Cheat Sheet

I created this file to compare markdown editors and test CSS style files for rendering/previewing it. DevonThink is an app that handles everything that is in this file.

The file also serves me as a tutorial and cheat sheet for markdown. 

I copied the material from other guides together, in particular the [Markdown Guide](https://markdownguide.org) and the [MultiMarkdown V6 Syntax Guide](https://rawgit.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-6-Syntax-Guide/master/index.html).
